    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> STEP 1
        Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm
        water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn
        onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can
        leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
    </p>
    <p> STEP 2
        Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room
        temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
    </p>
    <p>
        STEP 3
        Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured
        surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be
        very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
        STEP 4
        Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the
        oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes,
        drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or
        tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step
        for remaining pizza.
